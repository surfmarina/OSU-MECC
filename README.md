# OSU-MECC
Oregon State University: Marine Energy Colleigate Competition's WEC - Matlab simulink

Introduction - 
  the aim of the project is to design a wave energy converter (WEC). In order to physically build a WEC, it is imperative that we are able to run simulatiions on various WEG geometries, wave height/interval settings etc. to see how well our design will hold up. This is where WEC-Sim comes into play- this is a repository for the capstone team of 21-22 to work together on modeling various geometries.
